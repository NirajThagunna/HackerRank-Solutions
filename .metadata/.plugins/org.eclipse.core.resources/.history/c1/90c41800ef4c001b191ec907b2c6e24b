// In this challenge, you must read an integer, a double, and a String from stdin, then print the values according to the 
// instructions in the Output Format section below.

// Input Format
// There are three lines of input:
	// The first line contains an integer.
	// The second line contains a double.
	// The third line contains a String.

// Output Format
// There are three lines of output:
	// On the first line, print String: followed by the unaltered String read from stdin.
	// On the second line, print Double: followed by the unaltered double read from stdin.
	// On the third line, print Int: followed by the unaltered integer read from stdin.
